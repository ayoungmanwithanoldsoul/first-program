Population Growth and Food Security
Today’s global population has reached 7.4 billion, and it is estimated to increase to 9.5 billion in 2050, then 11.2 billion by 2100. The median age of this population is 30.1, with the make median age at 29.4 years and female, 30.9 years. Ninety-five percent of this population growth will happen in the developing countries, with demographers predicting that by the middle of this country, several countries will have tripled their population. The opposite is happening in the developed world where populations remain steady in general, but declining in some of the most advanced countries (Japan and Singapore). However, this scenario is not a run-off that could get out of control. Demographers predict that the world population will stabilize by 2050 to 9 billion, although they warn that feeling this population will be an immense challenge. The decline in fertility and the existence of a young productive population, however, may not be enough to offset this concern over food security. The Food and Agriculture 107
Organizations (FAO) warns that in order for countries to mitigate the impact of population growth, food production must increase by 70 percent; annual cereal production must rise to 3 billion tons from the current 2.1 billion; and yearly meat production must go up to 200 million tons to reach 470 million. The problem here is that the global rate of growth of cereals had declined considerably – from 3.2 percent in 1960 to just 1.5 percent in 2000. The FAO recommends that countries increase their investments in agriculture, craft long-term policies aimed at fighting poverty, and invest in research and development. The UN body also suggests that includes develop a comprehensive social service program that includes food assistance, consistent delivery of health services, and education especially for the poor. If domestic production is not enough, it becomes essential for nations to import. The FAO, therefore, enjoins governments to keep their markets open, and to eventually “move towards a global trading system that is fair and competitive, and that contributes to a dependable market for food.” The aforementioned are worthy recommendations but nation-state shall need the political will to push through these sweeping changes in population growth and food security. This will take some time to happen given that good governance is also a goal that many nations, especially in the developing world, have yet to attain.
Conclusion
Demography is a complex discipline that requires the integration of various social scientific data. As you have seen, demographic changes and policies have impacts on the environment, politics, resources, and other. Yet, at its core, demography accounts for the growth and decline of the human species. It may be about large numbers and massive effects, but it is ultimately about people. Thus, no interdisciplinary account of globalization is complete without an accounting of people. The next lesson will continue on this theme of examining people, and will focus particularly on their global movement
